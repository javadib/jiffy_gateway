    The ``worker_ready`` signal fires once the worker has successfully
    connected to the broker and is about to start consuming.  This is
    the right place for startup recovery because:
    - The Django app is fully initialised (settings, DB, Docker daemon).

    # --- 2. Re-dispatch orphaned queued tasks --------------------------------
    #
    # Known limitation: we cannot distinguish "genuinely orphaned" (the
    # worker crashed/restarted after the task was enqueued but before it
    # was picked up) from "still legitimately running" (a long-running
    # task that simply hasn't updated its status yet).  Re-enqueuing
    # a task that is still running will cause it to execute twice.
    #
    # Mitigation: ``acks_late=True`` + ``task_reject_on_worker_lost=True``
    # means the broker already re-delivers tasks when a worker dies.  The
    # startup recovery here mainly covers the case where *both* the broker
    # and worker were restarted (e.g. full host reboot) and the broker
    # lost unacked messages.  In that scenario no live worker holds the
    # task, so double-enqueue is not a concern.
    #
    # If this heuristic proves too aggressive in practice, consider adding
    # a ``started_at`` timestamp to the Task model and only re-dispatching
    # tasks whose ``started_at`` is older than a threshold (e.g. 2× the
    # expected max task duration).
